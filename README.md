# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug related to Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds.  The gradient is not rendering correctly as expected.

## Bug Description

When applying a linear gradient background using Tailwind CSS, the gradient does not appear as expected.  This might manifest as a solid color, no background at all, or an unexpected gradient variation. The problem occurs in specific circumstances depending on the CSS context, browser, or Tailwind CSS version.

## Solution

The solution might involve:

* **Checking for CSS Specificity Conflicts:**  Ensure that the gradient styles are not being overridden by more specific CSS rules.
* **Correct Syntax:** Double-check the syntax of the gradient declaration to ensure that it adheres to the Tailwind CSS specification.
* **Plugin Conflicts:**  Determine if conflicting plugins are interfering with the gradient application.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Test across different browsers to identify if the issue is browser-specific.
* **Tailwind CSS Version:** Update to the latest version of Tailwind CSS to see if the bug has been addressed in a recent release.
* **Purge CSS:**  Ensure that the gradient utility classes are not being purged during the build process if you are using PurgeCSS or a similar optimization technique.

The provided solution file offers one possible fix, but others may be necessary depending on the underlying cause.
